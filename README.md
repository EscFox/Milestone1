## Technology

The following technologies are used:
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Bootstrap V4.6.2

## External Tools

In addition to the technologies purely for creating the website, two external tools are used for logo design and image editing:
- Gimp
- Figma
- Git
- GitHub

## Typography

I have chosen the combination of:
- Questrial
- Raleway

## Color Scheme

The color palette consists of 4 colors, offering an elegant result:
- #FFFFFF
- #36B3A8
- #000000
- #1f1f1f

## Imagery

The main resources for accessing photographs and images are:
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)
- [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/)

## Icons

Regarding icons, they come from a single source:
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Web Page Design

The web page is designed with a mobile-first approach, making it fully responsive and adaptable to different devices.

The web page is structured into three distinct sections:

### Header

The header displays a background image overlaid with a semi-transparent black layer to enhance the visibility of the text. On this background image, there is a navigation bar consisting of a logo and a navigation menu. Below this top section, the company name, slogan, and a reservation button can be found.

### Body

The body consists of different sections depending on the page the user is on.

### Footer

The footer is divided into two distinct parts. The first part contains the logo and links to social media. Below this top level, the navigation menu is repeated. This allows users to navigate without having to scroll back to the top of the page.

Regarding the pages, there are three main pages and a modal form:

- **Home:** This page serves as the main page when the website is loaded. It provides a brief tour of the house and the services offered by Nom-Conn.

- **Services:** This page showcases the services offered by Nom-Conn, including office spaces, shared workspaces, and accommodation options.

- **Activities:** The activities page describes the various activities that can be enjoyed at Nom-Conn, accompanied by a diverse combination of images showcasing each activity.

- **Modal Form:** From any page, users can access the modal form that overlays the current page.

## File Structure

The website is composed of:
- HTML files:
  - index.html
  - activities.html
  - services.html
- Folders:
  - assets/
    Contains the images and logos used in the design.
  - css/
    - activitiesStyle.css
    - footerStyle.css
    - globalStyle.css
    - headerStyle.css
    - homepage.css
    - modalformStyle.css
    - services.css

Distributing the CSS properties across different files facilitates development and future modifications.

## Experience and Personal Opinion

The biggest challenge I encountered was the design aspect. Although there were some technical challenges, not having a clear vision of the website structure caused the most delays. Once I had a clear design and structure in place, composing the HTML and using Bootstrap became much smoother.

Something that was very helpful was testing different options, either with CSS or Bootstrap, even if they weren't directly for the project. Having tested so many possible scenarios, implementing the project when the ideas were clear became much simpler.
