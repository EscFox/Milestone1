# Deployment:
## Inception:
  - The project was initially created on GitHub and named Milestone1.
  - A local repository was created on my machine using Git.
  - To push this project from GitPod to GitHub, I executed a series of Git commands in the terminal:
  - git status - Checked the status of the repository to identify any file changes.
  - git add . - Added the modified/created files to be committed.
  - git commit -m "message for commit" - Committed all the changes with a descriptive message.
  - git push - Pushed all the committed versions to GitHub.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages:
    1.- Login to your GitHub account and navigate to the GitHub Repository.

    2.- In the top section of the repository, click on the "Settings" tab.

    3.- Scroll down to find the "GitHub Pages" section within the settings page.

    4.- Under the "Source" option, locate the dropdown menu labeled "None" and choose "Master Branch" from the available options.

    5.- After the page automatically refreshes, scroll down again to the "GitHub Pages" section, where you will find a live link to the published site.

## Cloning repository:
  - Local Clone
  - Log in to GitHub and locate GitHub Repository
  - At the top of repository click on Code
  - From the dropdown menu under HTTPS copy the link
  - Now on the IDE create a directory where you want to make the clone
  - Type git clone and paste the link that you copy from step 3.

## Forking repository:
By forking the GitHub Repository, we create a duplicate of the original repository on our GitHub account. This allows us to view and make changes to the repository without affecting the original version. The following steps are involved in forking the repository:

  - Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
  - At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on - - the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
  - You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## User Experience
The objective of the page is divided into two parts:
  - To create an initial satisfying impact through images and easy navigation among the different sections and pages of the website.
  - To showcase the various services and benefits of choosing Nom-Conn as a destination for their workspace for the desired period of time.
  
  The design of the website is based on the simplicity of navigation and information, focusing more on the presentation of the available services and the captivating images of each service, activity, and the Cottage. The aim is to entice the workers, making them feel attracted to the charm of the place.

  The website is not intended for users who have already used our services but rather to attract those who haven't. Once they become clients, they will become familiar with all the benefits and services offered.


  The web page is designed with a mobile-first approach, making it fully responsive and adaptable to different devices.

  The web page is structured into three distinct sections:

  ### Header

  The header displays a background image overlaid with a semi-transparent black layer to enhance the visibility of the text. On this background image, there is a navigation bar consisting of a logo and a navigation menu. Below this top section, the company name, slogan, and a reservation button can be found.

  ### Body

  The body consists of different sections depending on the page the user is on.

  ### Footer

  The footer is divided into two distinct parts. The first part contains the logo and links to social media. Below this top level, the navigation menu is repeated. This allows users to navigate without having to scroll back to the top of the page.

  Regarding the pages, there are three main pages and a modal form:

  - **Home:** This page serves as the main page when the website is loaded. It provides a brief tour of the house and the services offered by Nom-Conn.

  - **Services:** This page showcases the services offered by Nom-Conn, including office spaces, shared workspaces, and accommodation options.

  - **Activities:** The activities page describes the various activities that can be enjoyed at Nom-Conn, accompanied by a diverse combination of images showcasing each activity.

  - **Modal Form:** From any page, users can access the modal form that overlays the current page.

## User Feedback

After asking different colleagues to use the website and interact with it, I can summarize the conclusions in the following points:

  - **Attractive and professional design:** The majority of users find the design appealing, comparing it to websites found in real companies.

  - **Ease of use and intuitive navigation:** Once again, most users find the interaction with the website very intuitive and easy to use.

  - **Relevant and quality content:** This is where I start to find more varied opinions. Although a large portion of users agree that the presented information is relevant to understand what is being offered, some users would have preferred to find more detailed information about the services, location, etc.

  - **Fast loading time:** Some users have noticed that the loading of images takes longer on mobile devices. This could be due to the connection speed, as feedback varies for the same pages.

  - **Responsiveness and mobile compatibility:** All users agree that the visibility on mobile devices is excellent.

## Bugs and Technical Issues

  - 1:
    - **Issue:** Certain images fail to load on GitHub even though they load locally. The images were physically present in the correct location.
    - **Solution:** After reviewing multiple times, I realized that the error was due to the missing initial dot in the relative path "./". Although it didn't hinder local access, it caused the error on GitHub.
  - 2:
    - **Issue:** Modal form buttons lacked formatting.
    - **Solution:** The CSS stylesheet file was not included.
  - 3:
    - **Issue:** Local GitHub replication. When attempting to replicate the latest version from GitHub to local, I encountered problems and lost the changes I was working on locally.
    - **Solution:** I had to investigate how to recover previous commits and revert back until I found the correct commit.

## Experience and Personal Opinion & Aknowledgements

  The biggest challenge I encountered was the design aspect. Although there were some technical challenges, not having a clear vision of the website structure caused the most delays. Once I had a clear design and structure in place, composing the HTML and using Bootstrap became much smoother.

  Something that was very helpful was testing different options, either with CSS or Bootstrap, even if they weren't directly for the project. Having tested so many possible scenarios, implementing the project when the ideas were clear became much simpler.

  I would like to express my gratitude to Manu for his assistance throughout the process, as he has been attentive to those small details in order to achieve the highest possible grade.
